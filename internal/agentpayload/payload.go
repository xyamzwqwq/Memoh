// Package agentpayload defines the on-wire shapes for agent-emitted events
// forwarded to per-session SSE subscribers. Producers (cmd/agent and
// cmd/agent build their payloads via these helpers so the contract is
// exercised by one set of tests instead of being duplicated as map literals
// across packages.
//
// Any field added to the returned maps lands on the wire. The top-level
// `session_id` placement is load-bearing: internal/handlers/message_stream.go
// routes events by reading that key directly, without unwrapping nested
// objects.

// BackgroundTask builds the wire payload for a background task event. The
// publisher in cmd/agent's bgManager.SetEventFunc marshals this map and
// forwards it verbatim to the per-session SSE handler, which stamps `type`
// and `bot_id` on the way out.
